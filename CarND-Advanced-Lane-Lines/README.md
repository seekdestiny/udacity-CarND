### Abstract

The purpose of the project is to detect and track road lanes in a traffic video. The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Navigation
* Project pipelines are in `advanced-lane-lines.ipynb`.
* The images for camera calibration are stored in the folder called `camera_cal`.  
* The images in `test_images` are for testing the pipeline on single frames.
* All midstep test results are in folder called `output_images`

### Camera Calibration

The code for this step is contained in camera calibration and imaage undistortion part of the IPython notebook located in "adnaced-lane-lines.ipynb".  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `obj_pts_i` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `obj_pts` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `img_pts` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `obj_pts` and `img_pts` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:
